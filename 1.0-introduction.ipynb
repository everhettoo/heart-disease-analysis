    "\n",
    "In order to build ML models using similar dataset, understanding the actual problem the author <a href='International application of a new probability algorithm for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.'>Dr. Robert Detrano</a> tried solving using the dataset, is important.\n",

    "## Objective\n",
    "Though the data is being widely used in ML field, there are few questions:\n",
    "- The combined dataset should provide 920 records, but why only 303 records are always mentioned?\n",
    "- Could the data derived from this and published elsewhere have inherited the unspoken issue?\n",
    "- Without data transparency, how a model built on it can be trusted?\n",

    "For that, the following are carried out:\n",
    "1. Exploratory Data Analysis, to:\n",
    "    - define the problem statement\n",
    "    - investigate the data validity\n",
    "    - understand features relationship and importance\n",
    "2. Preprocessing - to prepare the data for model building\n",
    "3. Build and fine-tuning models:\n",
    "    - SVM\n",
    "    - LR\n",
    "    - ?\n",
    "4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "Mostly it's familiar ML pipeline (as described in Objective). Only during EDA, few turn taken, and it's worth explaining for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the image below:\n",
    "- During the EDA, missing value more 60% was discovered (as in 2.0), unexpected from processed dataset.\n",
    "- An investigation done on processed dataset for recovery - failed attempt (as in 2.1).\n",
    "- The raw dataset was processed first (2.3) then investigated (2.2) for recovery.\n",
    "- The recovered data was concatenated into DataFrame, EDA and other stages were continued.\n",
